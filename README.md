## Descriptions
The Fire Emblem Fates Optimisation tool is a program written in Python, with
the purpose of helping you get the right stat boosts for your child units
through the marriage system in Fire Emblem Fates. 

This application was written in 2017, when I was heavily playing
Fire Emblem Fates and wanted to optimise my sets as much as possible
for competitive purposes.
